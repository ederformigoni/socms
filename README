SOCMS is like the name says: simple and open.

01/11/2012 -- The simple coding begins...

The purpose of this project is to develop a piece of code (a bundle of php files) that can be easily
used and understood by the most ignoble coder in the world.

The system has 3 fundamental principles:
1) It will use only one database table. Maybe more but only if completely inevitable.
2) It will have a minimum set of files and folders.
3) It will bring stuff from major web sites (comments from social networks, images from file hosting
services, videos from video-sharing websites, and so on) and for this sole reason it may use external
SDKs, APIs, or other appropriate resource.

That's it for now.
